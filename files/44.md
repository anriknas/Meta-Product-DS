# Q44: Measure Success of Notifications

## 1. Mission Alignment
- **Meta’s Mission**: Help users stay connected and engaged.
- **Notifications Mission**: Prompt users at the right moment with the right content to bring them back to the platform.

## 2. Business Goals
- Increase re-engagement and retention.
- Drive discovery of new content, features, and connections.
- Ensure users perceive notifications as helpful, not spammy.

## 3. The "Why"
Notifications act as a **pull mechanism**. Their effectiveness impacts DAU, session frequency, and satisfaction. Poorly managed notifications can lead to churn or notification fatigue.

## 4. User Segmentation

| Segment           | Description                         | Behavior                             |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Power Users       | Use Meta daily, need relevance       | Tolerant of volume, value quality    |
| Lurkers           | Use infrequently, re-engagement target | Must deliver high-value notifications |
| Creators/Admins   | Moderate groups/pages                | Need actionable system alerts        |

## 5. Success Metrics

### Core Metrics
- Notification open rate
- Click-through to session
- % of DAU from notification-triggered sessions
- Time to open after push (promptness)

### Supporting Metrics
- Unsubscribe rate from notifications
- Block/report rate on notifications
- Notification fatigue score (survey)
- Notification → retention uplift (D1, D7)

## 6. Design & Trade-Offs

| Notification Type        | Pros                                 | Cons                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Personalized engagement   | High open rate                       | Requires data quality, personalization |
| Trending topic alerts     | Timely, increases content discovery  | May feel spammy                      |
| Feature promotion         | Educates user                        | Easily ignored, low intent           |

## 7. Strategies for Optimization
- ML-based notification prioritization
- Frequency capping by user type
- A/B testing notification copy and send times
- Smart bundling of low-priority alerts

## 8. MVP Optimization Plan
- Classify all notifications by type and user segment
- Set baselines for open rate, click-through, and session length
- Launch experiment to optimize timing + content relevance

## 9. Elevator Pitch
“Notifications drive re-engagement—but only when they’re timely, personal, and valuable. We’ll focus on relevance, reduce fatigue, and ensure every ping earns a user’s attention.”
