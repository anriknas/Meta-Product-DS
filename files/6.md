# Q6: Measure Success for Meta Events — Small vs. Large Event Users

## 1. Mission Alignment
- **Meta’s Mission**: “Give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.”
- **Events Mission**: Facilitate in-person and virtual gatherings to strengthen community ties.

## 2. Business Goals
- Drive daily engagement through recurring personal events.
- Retain creators and attendees by building habit loops.
- Build discovery surfaces that drive value across other Meta features (Groups, Calendar, Messenger).

## 3. The "Why"
We need to determine which event user segment drives more consistent engagement, retention, and long-term value to Meta’s ecosystem.

## 4. The "What"
Analyze usage and outcomes across **small event creators/attendees** (≤25 people) and **large event users** (>100 attendees) to prioritize product investments.

## 5. User Segmentation

| Segment         | Description                           | Use Case                            |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Small Event Users | Create private dinners, birthdays     | Frequent, high-touch engagement     |
| Large Event Users | Attend concerts, conferences          | Infrequent, high-volume impact      |
| Hybrid Users     | Do both                               | Broad feature needs                 |

## 6. Prioritization
Focus on **small event users** first:
- More frequent use = habit formation
- Drives social graph activity (invites, posts, comments)
- Long tail = more scalable engagement across demographics

## 7. Success Metrics

### Core Metrics
- Event creation rate (small vs large)
- RSVP and attendance rate
- Creator retention (30-day)
- Cross-feature engagement (e.g., posts after events)

### Supporting Metrics
- Event shares per user
- % of invitees who accept
- Time from creation to event date

## 8. Design & Trade-offs

| Focus Area           | Pros                                      | Cons                               |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Small Events         | More frequent, sticky engagement           | Low revenue individually           |
| Large Events         | Higher media & ad potential                | Infrequent usage, harder to retain |

## 9. MVP Strategy
- Improve RSVP flow for small events
- Auto-reminders via Messenger
- Templates for common use cases (e.g., dinner, birthday)

## 10. Elevator Pitch
“Meta Events empowers users to bring their communities together—from intimate gatherings to large public events. By focusing on small events, we foster frequent connections that build lasting habits and trust.”
