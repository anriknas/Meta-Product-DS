# Q51: New Feature Launch — Mobile Video Views ↑10%, Desktop Comments ↓20%. What Would You Do?

## 1. Context
- New feature drives **+10% video views on mobile** — a strong success indicator.
- But on desktop, **comments are down by 20%** — a potentially negative trade-off.

## 2. Step-by-Step Diagnostic

### A. Confirm Causality
- Run a **holdback test**: did only users exposed to the new feature show the comment drop?
- Is the new feature directly affecting desktop layout or experience?

### B. User Segmentation Analysis
- Who are the desktop users impacted most? (Creators? Viewers? Older demographics?)
- Did **time-on-page** or **scroll behavior** change?

### C. Analyze Behavioral Shifts
- Are users watching videos more passively?
- Are comments being replaced by reactions or shares?
- Did a UI change push the comment box out of view?

## 3. Hypotheses

| Observation                     | Possible Cause                          |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Desktop comments ↓              | UX change pushed comment section lower   |
| Mobile views ↑                  | Feature optimized for mobile experience  |
| Users engage less on desktop    | Consumption-focused design               |

## 4. Trade-Off Evaluation

| Impact Area       | Outcome                                 | Business Priority                        |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Mobile Engagement | +10% — valuable                          | High-priority growth metric               |
| Desktop Social    | -20% comments — possible churn risk      | Medium (depends on desktop user LTV)      |
| Total Watch Time  | If up overall, may justify trade-off     | Must balance experience with depth        |

## 5. Actions

### Short-Term
- A/B test layout tweaks to bring comments back into visibility.
- Add engagement nudges (e.g., “What did you think?” or comment overlays).
- Survey users who watched but didn’t comment.

### Long-Term
- Explore parity across platforms: make comment UX more consistent.
- Personalize engagement prompts based on user behavior (e.g., frequent commenters).

## 6. Success Metrics Going Forward

- Video completion rate (by platform)
- Comment rate per 1,000 views
- Comment quality (sentiment, replies)
- Retention rates for desktop users

## 7. Recommendation
Preserve the mobile uplift but **mitigate the desktop loss** by restoring comment accessibility without undoing the new feature’s gains.

## 8. Elevator Pitch
“Success shouldn’t come at the cost of community. We’ll protect mobile video growth while recovering lost desktop interaction through UI optimizations and targeted engagement nudges.”
