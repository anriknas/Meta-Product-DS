# Q2: Measure Success of Meta Campus

## 1. Mission Alignment
- **Meta’s Mission**: "Give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together."
- **Meta Campus Product Mission**: Help college students connect within their university through groups, events, chats, and shared experiences.

## 2. Business Goals
- Increase engagement among young users (18–24).
- Drive long-term retention by forming early habits.
- Create a pipeline of users who evolve from Campus into Meta’s broader ecosystem.
- Establish Meta as a go-to platform for both academic and social life.

## 3. The "Why"
We need to build Meta Campus to strengthen Meta’s presence among younger users by providing a private, relevant social space tied to their real-life community (university).

## 4. The "What"
We will build a university-specific experience within Facebook that allows students to discover campus-only groups, events, chats, and connections based on verified college affiliation.

## 5. User Segmentation

| Segment             | Description                               | Needs                            |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Freshmen            | New to college, looking for friends       | Discovery, Orientation           |
| Upperclassmen       | Settled, use for organizing events/groups | Group management, Job networking |
| Student Leaders     | Organize clubs and communities            | Tools, Engagement, Reach         |
| Alumni              | (Future segment) May return post-graduation | Reconnection, Mentorship       |

## 6. Prioritization
Start by targeting **Freshmen**, as they are actively looking to form social bonds, join groups, and discover the community.

## 7. Success Metrics

### Core Metrics
- DAU/MAU within Campus
- # of Campus-only groups created
- Event participation rates (per user)
- % of users who return after 7/30 days

### Supporting Metrics
- Invite rate per user
- Group join and creation rate
- Campus retention vs. non-Campus user retention
- Time spent in Campus experience vs. rest of app

## 8. Design & Trade-offs

| Design Choice             | Pros                                        | Cons                               |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Campus-only content       | Feels exclusive and private                 | May limit content discovery        |
| Require .edu verification | Ensures student authenticity                | Friction during sign-up            |
| Show recommended events   | Drives engagement and retention             | Privacy concerns if over-targeted  |

## 9. MVP Scope
- Email-verified onboarding with .edu address
- Campus groups and events surfaced on feed
- In-app directory of students (optional privacy settings)

## 10. Go-to-Market Strategy
- Partner with universities for pilot rollouts
- Promote in orientation events and student groups
- Offer incentives to group leaders to onboard early

## 11. Elevator Pitch
“Meta Campus is a private Facebook experience for college students to connect through verified groups, events, and chats—designed to build real-life relationships and boost student engagement during college and beyond.”
