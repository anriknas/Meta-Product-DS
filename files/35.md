# Q35: Evaluate Whether Meta Should Add Ads to Meta Messenger

## 1. Mission Alignment
- **Meta’s Mission**: “Help people stay connected with the people and communities that matter most.”
- **Messenger’s Mission**: Facilitate seamless, private communication.

## 2. Business Goals
- Unlock new ad revenue from a high-usage surface.
- Expand reach of Meta Ads beyond Feed and Stories.
- Leverage Messenger for conversation-based commerce (e.g., Click-to-Message ads).

## 3. The "Why"
Messenger has massive daily usage, yet is under-monetized. Ads could tap into a new revenue stream while enabling discovery and commerce.

## 4. The "What"
Introduce **non-intrusive ads** within Messenger, such as:
- Sponsored messages from businesses.
- Banner ads on the chat list or home screen.
- Sponsored replies after customer service interactions.

## 5. User Segmentation

| Segment             | Description                           | Ad Receptiveness                   |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Power Users         | Daily chat with friends/family         | Low — prioritize UX                |
| Commerce Users      | Engage with business messaging         | Medium — may tolerate sponsored follow-up |
| SMB Advertisers     | Want access to customers in Messenger  | High — clear demand                |
| Social Sellers      | Sell via Marketplace or Groups         | High — cross-promote offers        |

## 6. Prioritization
Focus on **Commerce Users and SMB Advertisers**, where ads enhance utility, not degrade experience.

## 7. Success Metrics

### Core Metrics
- Ad impressions and click-through rate (CTR)
- Revenue per message thread (RPMT)
- % of users who engage with sponsored messages
- Churn rate or time spent per session

### Supporting Metrics
- Ad relevance score (survey)
- Spam/block/report rate
- Impact on message response time

## 8. Design & Trade-Offs

| Option                      | Pros                               | Cons                               |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Sponsored inbox messages    | High CTR for business discovery     | May feel intrusive                 |
| Banner ads in chat list     | Passive, low impact                 | Low performance                    |
| Sponsored replies           | Contextual and useful               | Requires business opt-in setup     |

## 9. MVP Features
- Sponsored replies after business messages
- “Promoted Chat” card in chat list for businesses
- Ad settings for user control and opt-out

## 10. Recommendation
Start with **sponsored replies** tied to user-initiated business interactions—most aligned with user intent and least disruptive.

“By introducing contextual, opt-in ads in Messenger—especially tied to business interactions—Meta can unlock new revenue streams without compromising trust or user experience.”
