# Q76: Measure Success for Meta Stories — Engagement Up, Ads Revenue Down

## 1. Context
- Users are increasingly engaging with Meta Stories (views, replies, time).
- However, Stories ad revenue is declining.
- Goal: Diagnose the cause and recommend product or monetization strategy adjustments.

## 2. Key Questions
- Is user engagement increasing in ad-free contexts only?
- Is ad delivery broken or poorly targeted?
- Are advertisers pulling back from the Stories format?

## 3. Metrics to Analyze

| Category             | Metric                                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Engagement**       | Time spent on Stories, completion rate   |
|                      | Replies and re-shares                    |
| **Ad Inventory**     | Ad fill rate, impressions per session    |
|                      | Ad skip rate, completion rate            |
| **Revenue Metrics**  | CPM / eCPM trends                        |
|                      | Click-through rate (CTR)                |
| **User Feedback**    | Story ad sentiment, survey scores        |
| **Advertiser Behavior** | ROAS, ad spend trends                 |

## 4. Diagnostic Hypotheses

### Hypothesis A: Ad Placement Drop
- Engineering bug or decision reduced ad frequency unintentionally.

### Hypothesis B: Ad Relevance Declined
- Poor targeting leads to user skipping or ignoring ads.

### Hypothesis C: Shift to Creator-Heavy Stories
- More time spent on organic creator Stories with fewer ad slots.

### Hypothesis D: Policy or Inventory Constraints
- Sensitive content is reducing available ad inventory.

## 5. Potential Solutions

| Approach                            | Benefit                               | Risk                                 |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Improve ad targeting with engagement signals | Higher CTR, more relevance       | Complex ML integration                |
| Adjust frequency cap dynamically    | More monetization per session         | May annoy users                      |
| Insert mid-story native ads         | Increases ad real estate              | UX impact                            |
| Enable creator ad rev share         | More Story inventory via creators     | Attribution complexity               |

## 6. Recommendation
- Run an experiment to increase relevant, skippable ad units.
- Improve auction participation through better targeting.
- Segment engagement by user type and advertiser vertical.

## 7. North Star Metric
- **Revenue per 1,000 Story views**, while maintaining or growing engagement.

## 8. Elevator Pitch
“Meta Stories are engaging more users than ever, but monetization is falling behind. We’ll optimize ad delivery, targeting, and creator integration to align high usage with strong revenue performance.”
