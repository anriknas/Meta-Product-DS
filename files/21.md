# Q21: How Did You Align a Stakeholder Towards a Common Goal?

## 1. Scenario Summary
While working on a growth experiment for user referrals, the marketing team wanted maximum short-term conversion, while the product team prioritized user experience and long-term retention.

## 2. The Misalignment
- **Marketing** wanted to launch aggressive in-app prompts with limited dismissal options.
- **Product** worried it would harm the onboarding experience and churn new users.

## 3. My Approach to Alignment

### Step 1: Identify Shared Metrics
- Held a working session to align on a **North Star metric**: referral **conversion with retention** after 7 days.
- Proposed a blended metric: **conversion Ã— D7 retention**.

### Step 2: Data Modeling
- Created a dashboard showing trade-offs:
  - High-conversion prompt = -18% retention
  - Balanced prompt = +12% retention, slightly lower conversion

### Step 3: Propose Experiment Path
- Proposed **A/B/C test**:
  - Control
  - Marketing's version
  - Product-friendly version

### Step 4: Create a Common Goal Document
- Wrote a 1-pager outlining:
  - Shared objective
  - Risks
  - Success definition
  - Next steps

## 4. Outcome
- Marketing and Product agreed on the balanced test variant.
- Ultimately adopted the version with a **net 8% improvement in referral conversions** and no negative impact on retention.

## 5. Lessons Learned
- Stakeholder misalignment often stems from **metric divergence**.
- Building a **mutual win** requires shared KPIs and joint ownership of results.
