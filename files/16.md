# Q16: Measure Success for Meta Buy/Sell Groups — Creation Drop + Feature Prioritization

## 1. Context
- 10% MoM drop in buy/sell group creation.
- Engineer proposes showing **recommended items** inside groups.

## 2. Mission Alignment
- Meta’s Mission: “Build community.”
- Product Mission: Make local peer-to-peer commerce more accessible and useful.

## 3. The "Why"
Buy/sell group creation fuels supply and demand. A drop can reduce long-term liquidity and engagement.

## 4. Diagnostic Plan
### Questions to Ask:
- Are existing groups saturating demand?
- Did UX, ranking, or policy changes impact discovery or creation?
- Are users shifting to Marketplace instead?

### Metrics to Analyze:
- Active user base trend
- Conversion from join → list → transact
- Survey: Why aren’t users creating groups?

## 5. Evaluating Proposed Feature: Show Recommended Items

### Benefits:
- Keeps buyers engaged
- Helps new users find relevant listings
- Stimulates buying behavior → encourages more listings

### Risks:
- Relevance mismatch → frustration
- Cluttered group experience

## 6. Prioritization Framework: RICE

| Factor      | Score (1–10) | Notes                                     |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Reach       | 8            | Applies to all active buyers in groups    |
| Impact      | 6            | Could reverse drop indirectly             |
| Confidence  | 5            | No data yet on effectiveness              |
| Effort      | 3            | Medium (integration with recommender)     |

**RICE Score = (8×6×5)/3 = 80**

## 7. Recommendation
- Prioritize root-cause analysis immediately.
- Run limited A/B test for recommended items.
- Prepare follow-up features (e.g., onboarding group creators).

## 8. Success Metrics
- Group creation rate recovery
- Time spent viewing listings
- Buyer conversion rate (view → message)

## 9. Elevator Pitch
“To reverse the drop in buy/sell group creation, we’ll identify key friction points while testing discovery enhancements like recommended listings—boosting both supply and demand.”
