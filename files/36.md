# Q36: DAU for Messenger Flat in a Particular Market — What Would You Do?

## 1. Situation
Messenger Daily Active Users (DAU) in a specific region has plateaued. Engagement may be stalling due to competition, saturation, or UX friction.

## 2. Diagnostic Framework

### Step 1: Data Analysis
- **Cohort breakdown**: New vs returning users
- **Platform usage**: Android vs iOS
- **Usage trends**: Time spent, messages per user, open rate

### Step 2: External Factors
- New competition? (e.g., Telegram, WhatsApp)
- Network outages or app issues?
- Regulatory or privacy changes?

### Step 3: Qualitative Input
- NPS trends
- App store reviews
- Customer support tickets

## 3. Hypotheses

| Hypothesis                           | Verification Method                          |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Onboarding friction                  | Funnel drop-off in sign-up/activation data   |
| App fatigue/saturation               | Drop in time spent per user                  |
| Competition from other apps          | Market share shift data                      |
| Lack of feature innovation           | Survey feedback: “Why do you use competitors?”|

## 4. Action Plan

### Short-Term
- Improve onboarding flow or reduce friction points (if new user drop-off is high).
- Push win-back campaigns (e.g., “Reconnect with X”).
- A/B test “smart” notifications or reminders.

### Mid-Term
- Launch localized features or UI improvements based on cultural expectations.
- Partner with local creators or brands to drive engagement.
- Add Messenger-exclusive stickers, games, or formats.

### Long-Term
- Build interoperability with WhatsApp (if not restricted).
- Incentivize business use for messaging with brands.

## 5. Success Metrics

- DAU change post-intervention (weekly/monthly)
- Retention (D1, D7, D30)
- Time spent per session
- # of messages sent per user

## 6. Design & Trade-Offs

| Solution Type          | Pros                                | Cons                               |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Gamify messaging       | Increases fun and stickiness         | Might not appeal to all audiences  |

| Deep localization      | Stronger market fit                  | Requires extra engineering effort  |

## 7. Elevator Pitch
“To reignite growth in Messenger’s flat market, we’ll take a data-first approach—fixing friction, launching locally resonant features, and re-engaging users with personalized nudges and product innovation.”
