# Q45: Evaluate Whether to Remove the Profile Picture Upload Step — Set Goals and Measure Success

## 1. Mission Alignment
- **Meta’s Mission**: “Give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.”
- **Profile Picture Purpose**: Help people represent themselves and be recognized by others, increasing trust and social engagement.

## 2. The Decision at Hand
Should Meta **remove the profile picture upload step** from the onboarding flow to reduce friction?

## 3. Hypotheses

| Hypothesis                                     | Implication                                 |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Step causes friction → drop in sign-ups        | Removing it may improve sign-up completion  |
| Users who skip this step don’t engage later    | Removing it may reduce initial trust        |
| Users upload photos later anyway               | Step may not be needed upfront              |

## 4. Goal Setting

### Primary Goal
- **Increase sign-up completion rate** without hurting post-onboarding engagement.

### Secondary Goals
- Maintain or improve early trust indicators (e.g., messages accepted, friend requests approved).
- Ensure users eventually upload a profile picture within first X days.

## 5. Success Metrics

### Sign-up Flow Metrics
- Sign-up completion rate (before vs after removing step)
- Time-to-complete onboarding

### Engagement Metrics (Post-Onboarding)
- D1/D7 retention
- % of users with a profile picture after 3 days
- # of friend requests sent/accepted
- Messaging or commenting activity

### Trust Metrics
- Fake account detection rate
- User reports per 1,000 new sign-ups

## 6. Experiment Design

| Group       | Treatment                           | Expectation                                  |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Control     | Profile picture step present         | Baseline                                     |
| Variant A   | Step removed entirely                | Faster sign-ups, monitor long-term behavior  |
| Variant B   | Step skippable, delayed reminder     | Balance of friction and flexibility          |

Track behavior at 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day intervals.

## 7. Trade-Offs

| Option                          | Pros                             | Cons                                |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Remove step entirely             | Reduces friction                 | May reduce authenticity/trust       |
| Delay step post-onboarding       | Balanced UX                     | Delays profile completeness         |
| Keep step but make optional      | Gradual profile building         | May still be skipped without value  |

## 8. Recommendation
Use an **A/B test with a skippable and delayed upload reminder**, monitor retention, photo upload conversion, and interaction rates.

## 9. Elevator Pitch
“To improve sign-up completion while preserving user trust, we’ll test removing or deferring the profile picture step—ensuring we boost onboarding without hurting long-term community health.”
