# Q67: Measure Success for Meta Reactions

## 1. Mission Alignment
- **Meta’s Mission**: Help people express themselves and build connection.
- Reactions enable nuanced emotional expression beyond just “Like.”

## 2. Product Goals
- Increase user expressiveness in posts, comments, and messages.
- Encourage richer engagement across content types.
- Provide emotional feedback loop to creators and content producers.

## 3. User Segmentation

| Segment            | Description                             | Needs                               |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Everyday Users     | React to posts from friends              | Express nuanced emotions easily      |
| Creators/Publishers| Track sentiment of their content         | Feedback, engagement signals         |
| Businesses         | Monitor brand sentiment on content       | Analytics, response triggers         |

## 4. Success Metrics

### Engagement
- Reactions per user per day
- % of content with at least one reaction
- Distribution across reaction types (e.g., ❤️ 😂 😢 😡)

### Behavior Shift
- Change in comments per post (are reactions replacing or encouraging comments?)
- % of users using multiple reactions in a session
- Increase in engagement on low-comment content

### Creator/Publisher Feedback
- Creator insights on reaction breakdown
- Adoption of reaction analytics
- Sentiment trend tracking

### Platform Sentiment Health
- Reaction-based sentiment on controversial content
- % of reactions marked “misused” or “unclear”
- Reaction spam or bot usage detection

## 5. Trade-Offs

| Decision                        | Pros                                  | Cons                                   |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Add more reaction types          | More expressiveness                   | Cognitive overload, analysis complexity|
| Allow reactions on all content   | Ubiquity, more data                   | Noise or low-signal engagement         |
| Tie reactions to ranking         | Algorithmically useful                | Could incentivize manipulation         |

## 6. MVP Enhancements
- Reaction trends for creators
- Contextual prompts (“Why did you choose 😢?”)
- Temporarily limited reaction options for experiments

## 7. North Star Metric
- **Reactions per DAU**, segmented by content type

## 8. Elevator Pitch
“Meta Reactions succeed when people consistently use them to express real emotions, and when creators gain insight from that emotional feedback—measured by usage frequency, sentiment distribution, and creator adoption.”
