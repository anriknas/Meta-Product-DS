## 5. User Segmentation

| Segment             | Description                           | Key Needs                              |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| VR Enthusiasts      | Early adopters, tech-savvy            | Novelty, variety, realism              |
| Casual Users        | Join for specific events (e.g. concerts) | Simplicity, social features          |
| Creators/Partners   | Host or sponsor events                | Reach, tools, monetization             |
| Influencers         | Bring audiences to new venues         | Visibility, follower tools             |

## 6. Prioritization
Focus on **Casual Users**, as their attendance indicates scalability beyond the early adopter base and is critical for mainstream adoption.

## 7. Success Metrics

### Core Metrics
- Event attendance (MAU, DAU during events)

- % of users returning for a second event
- Headset activation or re-engagement due to events

### Supporting Metrics

## 8. Design & Trade-offs
