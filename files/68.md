# Q68: Measure Success for Instagram Reels — Reels Engagement is Growing but Stories Declining

## 1. Context
- **Observation**: Reels engagement is increasing, but Stories usage is declining.
- Question 1: How do we interpret this trend?
- Question 2: Is it better to prioritize **100 high-performing Reels** or **1M Reels with low view counts**?

## 2. Mission Alignment
- **Instagram’s Mission**: Bring you closer to the people and things you love.
- Both Reels and Stories foster expression and connection but serve different roles:
  - **Stories**: Close friends, ephemeral, high-frequency.
  - **Reels**: Broad discovery, entertainment, virality.

## 3. Framework to Assess Trade-Off

| Evaluation Dimension         | 100 Reels with 1M Views              | 1M Reels with 100 Views               |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Virality & Entertainment     | High-quality, scalable reach         | Democratized creation, long tail      |
| Creator Incentive            | Benefits top creators                | Encourages broad participation        |
| Content Quality              | Typically higher                     | Typically variable or lower           |
| Community Building           | Weaker (broadcast style)             | Stronger (more friends, niche sharing)|
| Resource Load (Infra)        | Less strain                          | More storage, moderation challenges   |

## 4. Success Metrics

### Reels
- Watch time per Reel
- Completion rate
- Shares, likes, and saves
- % of DAUs who post vs. only consume

### Stories
- Posts per user per day
- Viewer retention and tap-through rate
- Replies to Stories (signal of connection)
- Story-to-feed migration trends

### Ecosystem Health
- Balance between creator and viewer growth
- Creator feedback and fatigue
- Content redundancy or cannibalization

## 5. Diagnostic Actions
- Analyze whether top Reels creators are also active on Stories.
- Survey users to understand preference shifts.
- Check time allocation between surfaces (is it zero-sum?).

## 6. Strategic Recommendation
- Don’t pick one extreme. Prioritize:
  - **Hybrid strategy**: Encourage scalable Reels but invest in **low-friction Story creation tools** to support casual, personal sharing.
  - Cross-surface synergy: E.g., allow Stories to be turned into Reels easily.

## 7. North Star Metric
- **Time spent per user across both Reels and Stories**, with surface-level engagement parity over time.

## 8. Elevator Pitch
“Instagram should grow both expressive depth (Stories) and scalable reach (Reels). A strong ecosystem values not just viral hits but also the everyday moments that keep people connected.”
