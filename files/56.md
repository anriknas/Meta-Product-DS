# Q56: Measure Success for Launching a Clubhouse-Type App (Standalone)

## 1. Mission Alignment
- **Meta’s Mission**: Foster real-time connection and community.
- A standalone app allows faster iteration and avoids cannibalizing core apps (Facebook, IG).

## 2. Strategic Objective
- Establish presence in the live audio market.
- Differentiate with social context and superior discovery.
- Provide new tools for creators to grow voice-only communities.

## 3. User Segmentation

| Segment             | Description                             | Needs                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Early Adopters      | Trend-sensitive, social influencers      | Prestige, discovery, unique features   |
| Professional Hosts  | Use for talks, panels, education         | Scheduling, replay, analytics          |
| Hobby Groups        | Casual community chat                    | Group creation, low-friction UX        |
| Cross-posters       | Want to promote to IG/Facebook           | Seamless export/share tools            |

## 4. Core Success Metrics

### User Growth & Retention
- Daily/weekly active users
- % of users who return weekly
- Churn rate post first experience

### Engagement
- Avg. time spent per session
- # of rooms joined or hosted per user
- Listener-to-speaker conversion

### Creator Health

- Follower growth for hosts
- Monetization volume (if applicable)

### Platform Quality
- Report rate per 1K sessions
- Content quality feedback (surveys)
- Room abandonment rate

## 5. MVP Feature Set
- Live room hosting & discovery
- Raise-hand and co-host capabilities
- Invite-only access (early stage)
- Basic moderation & mute/block controls

## 6. Trade-Offs

| Decision                 | Pros                                   | Cons                                |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Standalone app           | Faster iteration                       | Split attention from core products  |
| Integrate with Meta ID   | Trust and discovery via friends         | Privacy concerns                    |
| No recording (early MVP) | Encourages spontaneity                 | No value for async users            |

## 7. Long-Term Vision
