# Q23: Tell Me About a Time You Managed Stakeholders and Risk

## 1. Context
While leading the rollout of a redesigned notifications center, several key teams (Growth, Integrity, Ads) had conflicting goals:
- Growth wanted **more notifications**
- Integrity wanted **less spam**
- Ads wanted **more sponsored actions**

## 2. Key Stakeholders
- PMs from each vertical
- Legal & policy team (for user controls)
- Senior leadership (CPO-level visibility)

## 3. Key Risks
- Overloading users = notification fatigue
- Under-delivering = less engagement
- Legal risk if controls are unclear

## 4. My Risk Management Strategy

### Step 1: Stakeholder Mapping
Identified each teamâ€™s priority and success metric.

### Step 2: Pilot Safeguards
Proposed a **gradual rollout** with:
- Frequency caps
- User opt-outs
- Split test variants

### Step 3: Create an Alignment Doc
Wrote a one-pager that summarized:
- Risks
- Dependencies
- Rollout stages
- Fallback plans

### Step 4: Weekly Syncs
Set up recurring check-ins with all stakeholders to share live dashboards and surface emerging issues.

## 5. Outcome
- Rolled out with **zero increase in user complaints**
- Growth saw +6% click-throughs on re-engagement
- Integrity signed off on audit trail and control surface

## 6. What I Learned
- Proactive transparency prevents last-minute blockers.
- Frame risk in terms of **metrics each stakeholder cares about**.
