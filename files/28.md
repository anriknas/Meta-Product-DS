# Q28: Meta Live — Engagement Down on News Feed

## 1. Context
Meta Live is thriving, but **News Feed engagement** is dropping. Possible cannibalization or user fatigue.

## 2. Hypotheses
- Live content is stealing attention from Feed.
- Algorithm prioritizes Live too heavily.
- Feed lacks fresh, engaging posts.

## 3. Diagnostic Plan

### Step 1: Traffic Flow
- Check referral sources from Feed → Live.
- Time shift: Are users watching Live during peak Feed hours?

### Step 2: Content Analysis
- Feed content quality drop?
- Are creators posting less to Feed in favor of Live?

### Step 3: User Segments
- Are younger users shifting behavior more than older?

## 4. Short-Term Actions
- Adjust ranking weights (Feed vs Live).
- Introduce post-Live Feed highlights to reconnect Feed.
- Add Feed-first previews of Live content.

## 5. Long-Term Strategy
- Improve Feed personalization and creator incentives.
- Launch “Recap Posts” for Live events in Feed.
- Merge Live + Feed for hybrid formats.

## 6. Success Metrics
- Recovery of Feed engagement (likes, comments, time)
- Feed → Live → Feed user flow rate
- Post-Live content engagement

## 7. Trade-Off Framework

| Action                      | Feed Impact | Live Impact | Complexity |
|-----------------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Prioritize Feed             | ↑           | ↓           | Low        |
| Merge highlights into Feed  | ↑           | ↔           | Medium     |
| Restrict Live exposure      | ↑ short-term| ↓ sharply    | High risk  |

## 8. Elevator Pitch
“Instead of choosing between Feed and Live, we’ll design for continuity—bridging the two surfaces to maximize total engagement without user fatigue or fragmentation.”
