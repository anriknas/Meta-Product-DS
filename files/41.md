# Q41: Evaluate Whether to Have Click-to-Play or Autoplay on Videos in News Feed

## 1. Mission Alignment
- **Meta’s Mission**: Help people discover and share meaningful content.
- **News Feed Mission**: Surface relevant, engaging content in a frictionless way.

## 2. Business Goals
- Maximize video engagement and watch time.
- Monetize video via ads and longer sessions.
- Maintain a positive user experience (no fatigue or data drain).

## 3. The "Why"
Autoplay increases impressions and video starts. Click-to-play protects user experience and bandwidth, especially in low-connectivity environments.

## 4. User Segmentation

| Segment              | Description                         | Video Behavior                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| High-bandwidth Users | Urban, Wi-Fi most of the time        | Tolerant of autoplay                   |
| Low-bandwidth Users  | Developing markets, metered data     | Prefer click-to-play                   |
| Passive Scrollers    | Browse more, engage less             | Autoplay may increase discovery        |
| Active Consumers     | Seek specific content                | Will click anyway                      |

## 5. Options Overview

| Option            | Pros                                 | Cons                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Autoplay**      | Higher impressions, better ad metrics | Annoyance, higher data usage          |
| **Click-to-play** | Better control, preserves data        | Lower reach, fewer views              |
| **Hybrid**        | Autoplay on Wi-Fi only                | Complexity in UX, inconsistency        |

## 6. Evaluation Metrics

### Engagement
- Video starts per user
- Avg. watch time per video
- Completion rate

### Experience
- User satisfaction (surveys)
- Video skip/back rate
- Bounce rate from Feed

### Monetization
- Ad impressions and view-through rate
- Revenue per video session

## 7. Recommendation
**Default to hybrid**:
- Autoplay on Wi-Fi or when user is on unlimited data.
- Click-to-play in low-bandwidth situations or on user request.

Allow user preference settings in control center.

## 8. A/B Test Setup
- Variant A: Full autoplay
- Variant B: Click-to-play
- Variant C: Hybrid based on network + preferences

## 9. Elevator Pitch
“To balance engagement and user experience, Meta should adopt a hybrid video strategy—autoplaying videos in high-bandwidth conditions while preserving user control elsewhere.”
