# Q74: Interpreting an A/B Test: IG Stories Usage Up 10%, Overall IG Usage Down 10%

## 1. Context
An A/B test increased **Instagram Stories** usage by 10% but led to a **10% decrease in total Instagram usage**. Your goal is to understand:
- Is this a healthy trade-off?
- Is this cannibalization or behavior shift?
- Should the feature be launched?

## 2. Clarifying Hypotheses
- **H1**: Stories are cannibalizing Feed, Reels, or Explore usage.
- **H2**: The feature increased friction in other surfaces (e.g., navigation).
- **H3**: Stories growth is net positive in the long term (e.g., retention benefit).

## 3. Diagnostic Metrics

| Metric                            | Insight Provided                    |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Time spent per surface           | Understand which surface dropped    |
| # of sessions per user           | Fewer sessions or shorter sessions? |
| % of users opening other surfaces| Behavioral fragmentation            |
| Bounce rate or exit post-story   | Engagement cliff                    |
| DAU retention (D1, D7, D30)      | Long-term impact                    |

## 4. Segment Analysis
- Was the drop uniform across user types?
- New users vs. power users?
- Region-specific effects?

## 5. Strategic Paths

### Option A: Rollback
- If drop in overall use harms monetization or retention.

### Option B: Iterate
- Adjust navigation or content flow to reduce cannibalization.
- Add cross-prompts: e.g., after 3 Stories, suggest a Reel.

### Option C: Launch Selectively
- Keep feature for segments where overall engagement net positive.

## 6. Trade-Offs

| Decision           | Pros                                  | Cons                                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Prioritize Stories | Capture newer usage behaviors         | Lose engagement on revenue surfaces   |
| Optimize for total usage | Better ecosystem balance         | May under-leverage Stories potential  |

## 7. Recommended Next Steps
- Run follow-up experiments to isolate cause of drop.
- Survey users post-session.
- Track long-term user stickiness on Stories vs. Feed.

## 8. Elevator Pitch
“Before launching the Stories feature, we need to evaluate whether the increased Stories use creates a net positive effect on retention and revenue—or if it siphons off more valuable engagement elsewhere. Further diagnostics and iteration are needed.”
