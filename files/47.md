# Q47: Measure Success for Meta’s Unauthenticated (Login) Page

## 1. Mission Alignment
- **Meta’s Mission**: “Give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.”
- **Login Page Mission**: Seamlessly transition users into the platform while optimizing conversions and protecting security.

## 2. Business Goals
- Maximize successful logins and new sign-ups.
- Reduce bounce and login failure rates.
- Offer easy reactivation for dormant users.
- Maintain strong account protection against fraud.

## 3. The "Why"
The unauthenticated page is a critical entry point — it influences new user acquisition, returning user retention, and trust in platform security.

## 4. User Segmentation

| Segment              | Description                          | Primary Goals                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| New Users            | First-time visitors                   | Easy sign-up, understand value fast    |
| Returning Users      | Existing accounts, regular users      | Fast login, password recovery options  |
| Dormant Users        | Haven’t logged in for months/years    | Reminder of value, reactivation path   |
| Shared Devices Users | Logging in from public or family devices | Security, easy logout, safe session  |

## 5. Success Metrics

### Engagement
- Bounce rate on login page
- Login conversion rate (visit → successful login)
- Time to complete login or sign-up
- % of users completing forgotten password flows

### Trust & Security
- Account lockout or recovery attempt rates
- Login from unusual location/device detection
- Two-factor adoption rate

### Re-Engagement
- % of dormant users who return and stay active
- Session depth after login (returning users)

## 6. Design Trade-Offs

| Option                      | Pros                                | Cons                                   |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Simplified login screen     | Faster conversion                    | Less space for brand trust cues        |
| Social login integration    | Reduces friction                     | May introduce 3rd-party dependency     |
| Emphasizing sign-up CTA     | Boosts new acquisition               | Could confuse returning users          |
| Showing recent account(s)   | Faster login                         | Shared device privacy risk             |

## 7. Optimizations to Explore
- Progressive disclosure: show login by default, expand to sign-up
- Localized trust indicators (security badge, endorsements)
- Smart email/phone autofill and login hints

## 8. Elevator Pitch
“The login page is our front door. By optimizing for clarity, speed, and trust, we turn hesitant visitors into loyal users—and dormant accounts into re-engaged ones.”
