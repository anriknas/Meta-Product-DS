# Q13: Measure Success for Meta Groups Focused on Buying and Selling

## 1. Mission Alignment
- **Meta’s Mission**: “Give people the power to build community.”
- **Product Mission**: Enable trusted, community-driven commerce within group environments.

## 2. Business Goals
- Increase peer-to-peer transactions inside Groups.
- Drive engagement through local exchange and interaction.
- Lay foundation for future monetization via tools, ads, or seller services.

## 3. The "Why"
Buy/sell groups let users transact with real people they know or trust (e.g., neighbors, friends of friends), building both utility and engagement in communities.

## 4. The "What"
Buy/sell Groups allow users to post listings, negotiate prices, and arrange sales in a group setting moderated by admins or community rules.

## 5. User Segmentation

| Segment             | Description                          | Needs                             |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Sellers             | Listing goods for cash               | Visibility, reach, ease of posting|
| Buyers              | Looking for local deals              | Trust, item quality, convenience  |
| Admins              | Run group, ensure safety             | Moderation tools, rules           |

## 6. Prioritization
Prioritize **Buyers**, since seller success depends on their engagement and trust.

## 7. Success Metrics

### Core Metrics
- Listings created per day
- Listing engagement (views, comments, messages)
- Successful transactions (self-reported)
- Group retention after buy/sell activity

### Supporting Metrics
- Repeat listing rate
- Buyer conversion rate
- Spam or fraud reports

## 8. Design & Trade-offs

| Feature               | Pros                                  | Cons                             |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Structured listings   | Easier discovery, consistent UX        | Learning curve for casual users  |
| Message to seller CTA | Fast negotiation                      | Less transactional transparency  |
| Comments as bids      | Transparent pricing                    | May clutter post thread          |

## 9. MVP Scope
- Structured listings (title, price, photo, description)
- “Interested” button + messaging
- Admin controls for spam and fraud

## 10. Elevator Pitch
“Buy/Sell Groups on Meta turn communities into trusted marketplaces, letting people transact safely with those they already know—no need for separate apps or platforms.”
