# Q75: Measure Success of Instagram Stories (Before Launch)

## 1. Mission Alignment
- **Instagram’s Mission**: Bring users closer to the people and things they love.
- **Stories** allow users to share authentic, ephemeral content in a casual, low-pressure format—driving both creation and daily engagement.

## 2. Product Goals
- Increase frequency of content sharing.
- Deepen friend graph interaction (close friends).
- Retain users by encouraging habitual, daily use.

## 3. Pre-Launch Considerations

### Hypotheses
- Stories will increase time spent per day.
- Users will post more frequently when friction is lower.
- Casual creators will engage more compared to feed posters.

## 4. Success Metrics

| Category           | Metric                                      |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Engagement**     | % of DAUs who view at least one story       |
|                    | Stories created per user per day            |
|                    | Time spent on Stories surface               |
| **Creation**       | Ratio of creators to consumers              |
|                    | Story completion rate                       |
| **Retention**      | D1, D7, D30 retention changes post-launch   |
|                    | Session frequency uplift                    |
| **Cannibalization**| Drop in feed engagement                     |
|                    | Time shifted between surfaces               |

## 5. MVP Features
- Story camera with stickers, filters
- Viewer list for creators
- 24-hour expiration
- Privacy settings (e.g., Close Friends)

## 6. Risks & Trade-Offs

| Risk                                | Mitigation                            |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Cannibalization of Feed             | A/B test total usage impact            |
| Content fatigue (repetitive stories)| Limit frequency or show variety        |
| Privacy concerns                    | Fine-grained controls for sharing      |

## 7. Pre-Launch Testing Plan
- A/B test with a subset of users (e.g., 5%)
- Survey story creators and viewers
- Compare session length and re-engagement

## 8. North Star Metric
- **Stories engagement per DAU**, with neutral or positive impact on total time spent.

## 9. Elevator Pitch
“Instagram Stories should increase lightweight content creation and drive habitual engagement—success is measured by posting frequency, time spent, and retention lift without cannibalizing other surfaces.”
