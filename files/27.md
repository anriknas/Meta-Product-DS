# Q27: Meta Live — Trade-off: Enforce Guidelines vs. North Star Metric (Engagement)

## 1. Context
Live content moderation enforcement could reduce violations by 95%, but at the cost of a drop in the North Star Metric (e.g., viewership, time spent).

## 2. The Dilemma
- **Option A**: Remove harmful content → trust, brand safety ↑, engagement ↓
- **Option B**: Keep content → metrics ↑ short-term, trust ↓ long-term

## 3. Strategic Trade-Off

### Core Question:
> Does the long-term value of trust outweigh short-term metric drops?

**Yes.** Content safety is foundational to sustainable growth.

## 4. Decision Framework

| Option           | Trust Impact | Engagement Impact | Brand/Safety Risk      |
|------------------|--------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Strict Moderation| High ↑       | Medium ↓          | Low                    |
| Soft Moderation  | Medium        | Low               | Medium (PR/legal risk) |
| No Moderation    | Low           | High (short-term) | High                   |

## 5. Proposed Path
- Enforce violations immediately.
- Invest in ML-based live moderation tools.
- Launch creator education on guidelines.
- Offer appeal process + audit trail.

## 6. Success Metrics
- % reduction in guideline violations
- User trust score (surveys, complaints)
- Creator satisfaction
- Long-term retention of viewers

## 7. Elevator Pitch
“User trust is the foundation of engagement. By reducing harmful content in Meta Live—even at a short-term cost—we build a safer, sustainable platform for users and creators alike.”
