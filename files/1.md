- **Anti-Scamming Product Mission**: Build safer communities by protecting users from fraud and misinformation.

## 2. Business Goals
- Improve user safety and trust.

- Preserve integrity of monetizable features (e.g., Marketplace, Messenger).

## 3. The "Why"

## 4. The "What"
We will build an AI-driven anti-scamming product that proactively detects and prevents scams across Meta surfaces (Messenger, Groups, Marketplace), allowing users to report and respond to suspicious activity in real-time.

## 5. User Segmentation

| Segment               | Description                            | Risk Level |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|------------|
| Casual Users          | Social users unfamiliar with scams     | High       |
| Power Users           | Frequent users who rely on Meta daily  | Medium     |
| Marketplace Sellers   | May be targeted by scammers            | High       |
| Previously Scammed    | More cautious, sensitive to threats    | High       |
| Tech-Savvy Users      | More adept at detecting scams          | Low        |

## 6. Prioritization
Prioritize **Casual Users** and **Marketplace participants**, as they are most vulnerable and represent large, high-impact segments.

## 7. Success Metrics

### Core Metrics
- % reduction in scam reports
- Detection accuracy (True positive rate, False positive rate)
- Time-to-detection and response
- Number of proactive interventions taken

### Secondary Metrics

## 8. Design & Trade-offs

| Design Choice            | Pros                                | Cons                                |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Aggressive Detection     | Higher protection                    | Risk of false positives             |
| User-initiated Reporting | More accurate from real-world input  | Reactive, not proactive             |
| ML Model + Human Review  | Balanced approach                    | Requires human ops investment       |
