# Q43: Measure Success for Meta Marketplace — Listings Usage Down, Time Spent Up, News Feed Time Down

## 1. Observations
- **Listings usage is down** (users are creating or browsing fewer listings).
- **Time spent in Marketplace is up** (users spend more time on fewer items).
- **News Feed time is down** (possible cannibalization or content fatigue).

## 2. Key Hypotheses

| Observation                | Hypothesis                                         |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Listings usage ↓           | Supply fatigue, search friction, lower relevance   |
| Time spent ↑               | Users are browsing deeply on fewer items           |
| News Feed time ↓           | Marketplace is pulling time from Feed              |

## 3. Diagnostic Plan

### Step 1: Funnel Breakdown
- Listing creation funnel: where are users dropping off?
- Browse → message → purchase funnel: is buyer intent still strong?

### Step 2: Segment Analysis
- Are power sellers/buyers behaving differently than casual users?
- Is usage dropping in certain geographies or categories?

### Step 3: Cross-Surface Analysis
- Check entry points to Marketplace (Feed, search, bookmarks).
- Has algorithm over-prioritized Marketplace links in Feed?

## 4. Response Framework

### Listings Down
- Improve listing creation UX (fewer steps, faster upload).
- Offer seller incentives (badges, boosts, instant replies).
- Auto-fill info using image detection or price suggestions.

### Time Spent Up
- Investigate: is time productive or friction-based?
- Reduce friction: better filters, faster load, cleaner UI.

### Feed Time Down
- Reduce Marketplace cross-links in Feed.
- Introduce cross-content: “Trending from Marketplace” in Feed.

## 5. Success Metrics to Watch

- Listings per user (weekly)
- Avg. time to message or convert per listing
- Feed → Marketplace → return to Feed rate
- Retention of sellers
- Bounce rate on listing pages

## 6. Recommendation
- Short-term: address listing creation drop-off.
- Medium-term: rebalance Feed-Marketplace traffic.
- Long-term: redesign browsing to increase intent and reduce endless scroll.

## 7. Elevator Pitch
“When Marketplace usage metrics diverge, we look deeper. We'll fix listing drop-offs, simplify browsing, and ensure Feed and Marketplace grow together—without cannibalizing each other.”
