# Q25: Meta Lite – NSM Down 10%: What Do You Do?

## 1. Context
North Star Metric (e.g., DAU, posts per user) has dropped by 10%. Meanwhile, the team has been testing **ad load increases** in Lite.

## 2. Hypothesis
- Increased ad load is leading to:
  - Slower load times
  - Higher data usage
  - Lower retention among bandwidth-constrained users

## 3. Immediate Actions

### Step 1: Segment Impact
- Geo breakdown (e.g., Africa vs. India)
- Device + OS breakdown
- Retention curves (did churn start post-ad changes?)

### Step 2: A/B Test Analysis
- Compare engagement drop between test and control.
- Review time to first post, time to interaction.

### Step 3: User Feedback
- Check Play Store reviews, in-app surveys, support tickets.

## 4. Decision Framework

| Option                       | Growth Impact | Revenue Impact | Risk                              |
|------------------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Roll back ads                | Restore growth | Lose revenue    | Slower monetization               |
| Reduce ad frequency in Lite  | Partial fix    | Moderate loss   | Balances user experience          |
| Offer ad-free Lite Plus      | Retain revenue | Experiment only | Complexity of freemium model      |

## 5. Recommendation
- Roll back ads temporarily to restore core metrics.
- Build a **Lite-specific ad format** (lightweight, native).
- Track impact on DAU and user satisfaction closely.

## 6. Success Metrics
- DAU recovery
- Retention D7/D30
- Time to first action post-load
- Ad click-throughs (post-fix)

## 7. Elevator Pitch
“To maintain Lite’s growth in bandwidth-constrained regions, we’ll prioritize performance and trust—rebalancing monetization with lightweight, user-first advertising.”
