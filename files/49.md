# Q49: Measure Success for Uber Eats’ Group Ordering Feature — NSM Up, Ratings Down

## 1. Context
Uber Eats launched **group ordering**, allowing users to join a shared cart and place a single delivery. 
- **North Star Metric (NSM)**: Group orders increasing.
- **Problem**: Order **ratings have dropped** significantly.

## 2. Mission Alignment
- **Uber Eats Mission**: "Make eating well effortless for everyone."
- **Group Ordering Goal**: Facilitate collaborative food ordering for friends, families, and offices.

## 3. Success Metrics

### Positive Signals (Metric Uplift)
- Number of group orders per day
- Avg. order size (AOV increase)
- Customer retention for group creators

### Red Flags
- Drop in average order rating
- Increase in complaints (missing/incorrect items)
- Delivery ETA variance (larger group orders harder to fulfill)

## 4. Diagnostic Questions

| Area                     | Investigative Questions                          |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| User Experience          | Is UI confusing (e.g., cut-off times, item lock)?|
| Order Complexity         | Do large or diverse orders confuse restaurants?  |
| Logistics/Delivery       | Are group orders delaying delivery for others?   |
| Expectations             | Are group members less informed about constraints?|

## 5. Trade-Off Analysis

| Scenario                                   | Interpretation                            | Suggested Action                        |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| NSM ↑, Ratings ↓ due to logistics issues   | Scale issue                                | Partner with top restaurants only        |
| NSM ↑, Ratings ↓ due to UX                 | Communication problem                      | Add confirmations, real-time status      |
| NSM ↑, Ratings ↓ but NPS remains neutral   | Acceptable trade-off                       | Monitor further                          |

## 6. Suggested Fixes

- **Improve transparency**: Show clear order lock time to group members.
- **Smart batching**: Allow restaurants to flag large group order support.
- **Order splitting**: Let users receive items separately if feasible.
- **Notifications**: Let each member track their item’s status.

## 7. A/B Test Suggestions

| Variant A         | Group order with default UX                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Variant B         | Group order with real-time updates & ratings prompt per member |

Compare both on CSAT, rating recovery, and re-engagement.

## 8. Recommendation
Don't halt group ordering. **Iterate on fulfillment and transparency** to recover ratings while sustaining growth.

## 9. Elevator Pitch
“Group orders are working, but execution is hurting the experience. We'll fine-tune the flow, clarify responsibilities, and support restaurants better—ensuring convenience doesn’t come at the cost of quality.”
