|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Casual Listeners   | Join passively or while multitasking    | Discovery, low friction, good content|
| Active Speakers    | Regularly host or contribute            | Tools, analytics, safety             |
| Communities        | Clubs, study groups, niches             | Room privacy, member invites         |
| Influencers        | Drive traffic from IG/FB                | Cross-platform promotion             |
