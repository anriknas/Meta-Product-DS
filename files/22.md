# Q22: Measure Success for Meta Jobs

## 1. Mission Alignment
- **Meta's Mission**: Build community and create meaningful social utility.
- **Product Mission**: Help people discover, apply, and get hired for local jobs—especially in underserved markets.

## 2. Business Goals
- Increase daily utility of Meta's platform.
- Compete with LinkedIn for blue-collar, gig, and small business hiring.
- Create new ad surfaces (paid job listings).

## 3. The "Why"
Meta already connects people socially. Jobs is a natural extension—helping users improve their economic status through existing social infrastructure.

## 4. The "What"
A platform embedded in Facebook or Marketplace that allows small businesses and individuals to post jobs and apply via Messenger or email.

## 5. User Segmentation

| Segment            | Description                        | Needs                                  |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Job Seekers        | Often blue-collar, mobile-first    | Easy search, fast application          |
| SMBs               | Local shops, restaurants, services | Affordable, trusted applicants         |
| Recruiters         | Mid-sized employers                | Pipeline, filtering                    |

## 6. Prioritization
Focus on **SMBs and Job Seekers**, where speed and cost are most critical, and existing hiring platforms may not serve well.

## 7. Success Metrics

### Core Metrics
- Jobs posted per day/week
- Apply clicks per job
- Time to first applicant
- Application-to-hire conversion (self-reported)

### Supporting Metrics
- Retention of SMBs who post jobs
- % of job seekers who apply to multiple jobs
- Engagement via Messenger post-application

## 8. Design & Trade-offs

| Feature Option         | Pros                              | Cons                               |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1-click Apply          | Low friction                       | Less screening                     |
| Messaging-only flow    | Real-time chat                     | Hard to track application status   |
| Job Boosting (paid)    | Monetization path                  | Could disadvantage small players   |

## 9. MVP Scope
- Job post templates for SMBs
- “Apply via Messenger” button
- Job alert opt-ins for seekers

## 10. Elevator Pitch
“Meta Jobs connects local employers with motivated job seekers in minutes—not weeks—using the tools they already use daily.”
