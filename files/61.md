## 1. Mission Alignment
- **Meta’s Mission**: Help people build community and connect.
- Voice-first formats lower the barrier to live engagement and allow for multitasking, casual presence, and intimacy in creator-fan or community interactions.

## 2. Product Goal

- Serve creators, group admins, and niche communities.

## 3. User Segmentation

|--------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Creators           | Host live voice sessions, engage fans    | Easy hosting, analytics, monetization |
| Communities        | Run group discussions or announcements   | Access control, moderation            |
| Casual Listeners   | Drop into voice sessions passively       | Easy discovery, minimal friction      |
| Friends Groups     | Use for hangouts or discussions          | Scheduling, notifications             |
