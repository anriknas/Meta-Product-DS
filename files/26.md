# Q26: Measure Success for Live Events

## 1. Mission Alignment
- **Meta’s Mission**: “Bring the world closer together.”
- **Product Mission**: Enable people to gather virtually in real-time around events that matter to them—concerts, talks, watch parties, etc.

## 2. Business Goals
- Boost time spent on platform.
- Build creator monetization tools (ticketing, tipping).
- Increase audience participation through real-time interaction.

## 3. The "Why"
Live Events increase engagement, community feeling, and monetization opportunities—especially with creators and brands.

## 4. The "What"
Live Events allow users to attend real-time performances or community events, integrated with chat, reactions, invites, and payment.

## 5. User Segmentation

| Segment           | Description                          | Key Needs                         |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Hosts/Creators    | Running the live event               | Visibility, tools, monetization   |
| Viewers/Fans      | Attend and interact                  | Reactions, chat, low latency      |
| Event Marketers   | Promote high-traffic events          | Analytics, cross-platform reach   |

## 6. Prioritization
Focus on **Viewers**, as engagement, reactions, and retention make the platform sticky and grow the ecosystem for creators.

## 7. Success Metrics

### Core Metrics
- Live viewership (concurrent + total)
- Average watch time
- Comment/reaction volume per viewer
- Share rate of live events

### Supporting Metrics
- Revenue per live stream (if monetized)
- Creator retention
- Post-event replays and engagement

## 8. Design & Trade-offs

| Feature Option           | Pros                             | Cons                              |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Interactive chat         | Drives engagement                | Moderation challenges             |
| Ticketed access          | Monetization                     | Access friction                   |
| Multi-hosting            | Adds value to large events       | Coordination complexity           |

## 9. MVP Scope
- Live video + chat + reactions
- Event discovery tab
- Post-event archive and replay

## 10. Elevator Pitch
“Meta Live Events bring communities together in real time—whether it’s a concert, Q&A, or fan meetup—enabling creators to perform and users to connect live, from anywhere.”
