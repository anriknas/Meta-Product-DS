# Q32: Evaluate Showing Ads for Meta Marketplace on Users’ Timeline & Measure Success

## 1. Context
You're considering injecting **Marketplace product ads into the main Facebook timeline** to drive more discovery.

## 2. Mission Alignment
- **Facebook Feed**: Engage users with content from friends, communities, and interests.
- **Marketplace Ads**: Add local commerce utility to Feed, increasing discoverability of listings.

## 3. Business Goals
- Drive traffic to Marketplace via high-traffic Feed.
- Increase buyer-side discovery.
- Create new monetizable ad surface for local commerce.

## 4. The "Why"
The Feed is the most engaged surface on Facebook. Repurposing it to cross-promote listings can improve Marketplace liquidity without requiring user intent/search.

## 5. The "What"
Inject native-style Marketplace listings (or promoted ads) into the user’s News Feed with clear visual identifiers.

## 6. Hypotheses
- Pros: Higher visibility for sellers, more buyer engagement, ad revenue.
- Cons: May reduce News Feed relevance or satisfaction, risk of spam perception.

## 7. User Segmentation

|--------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Commerce-Engaged   | Browse Marketplace frequently        | Low              | High                      |
| Passive Browsers   | Rarely use Marketplace               | Medium           | Medium                    |
| Non-Shoppers       | Never use Marketplace                | High             | Low                       |

## 8. Success Metrics

## 10. Design Trade-offs

| Decision                    | Pros                                 | Cons                                |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Native-style listings       | Feels organic                         | Risk of blending commerce and social|
| Only show to buyers         | Higher CTR                            | Limits total reach                  |
| Allow promoted listings     | Monetization                          | Perception of “pay-to-play”         |

## 11. Recommendation
- Start with low-frequency, interest-based injections.
- Limit to users with prior commerce engagement.
- Monitor Feed quality metrics carefully.

## 12. Elevator Pitch
“We can grow Marketplace by surfacing relevant listings inside the Feed. With careful targeting and native design, we unlock discovery and revenue without degrading user experience.”
