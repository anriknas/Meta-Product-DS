|------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Passive Members  | Read-only, occasional visitors         | Consume content, rarely post       |
| Active Posters   | Post, comment, and react frequently    | Drive discussion and community     |
| Admins/Mods      | Set rules and moderate                 | Ensure safety and relevance        |
| New Joiners      | Recently added to the group            | Form first impressions quickly     |
