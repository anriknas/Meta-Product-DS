# Q24: Measure Success for Meta Lite

## 1. Mission Alignment
- **Meta’s Mission**: Bring the world closer together—especially in bandwidth- or resource-constrained areas.
- **Lite Mission**: Make Meta accessible to users with low-end devices and limited connectivity.

## 2. Business Goals
- Drive adoption and retention in emerging markets.
- Maintain user base where standard app isn’t viable.
- Lighten infrastructure costs while preserving engagement.

## 3. The "Why"
Meta Lite fills a crucial accessibility gap. Without it, entire markets (e.g., rural India, parts of Africa) would churn or never convert.

## 4. The "What"
A lightweight version of the Facebook app, optimized for 2G/3G networks and low-memory phones.

## 5. User Segmentation

| Segment             | Description                           | Needs                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Rural Users         | Low-end Android, poor connectivity     | Speed, basic features, reliability     |
| First-Time Users    | Just joined Meta                       | Easy onboarding, fewer distractions    |
| Low-Literacy Users  | May struggle with complex UI           | Simplicity, visual cues                |

## 6. Prioritization
Target **Rural and First-Time Users** — they represent the bulk of Lite installs and are highly sensitive to friction.

## 7. Success Metrics

### Core Metrics
- App Load Time (P50, P90)
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Feature completion rate (post, like, comment)
- Retention D1, D7, D30

### Supporting Metrics
- Crash-free sessions
- % of sessions under 1MB data usage
- Feedback scores on Play Store

## 8. Design & Trade-offs

| Design Decision         | Pros                                 | Cons                               |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Static content          | Loads faster                          | Feels outdated                     |
| Smaller image sizes     | Saves data                            | Lower visual appeal                |
| Offline caching         | Allows offline use                    | Sync complexity                    |

## 9. MVP Optimization
- Prioritize post, comment, like
- Simplify profile flow
- Cache feed content offline

## 10. Elevator Pitch
“Meta Lite is Facebook reimagined for the next billion users—built to work reliably anywhere, anytime, on any device.”
