# Q5: Ads in Meta Dating Caused Engagement Drop — What Would You Do?

## 1. Clarify the Problem
- A/B test showed engagement dropped when ads were introduced into Meta Dating.
- Likely metrics: reduced match rate, messages per user, or session time.

## 2. Hypothesize Causes
- Ad placement is disrupting core experience (e.g., between profile views or messages).
- Users perceive dating as intimate and ads feel intrusive.
- Ads are irrelevant or poorly targeted.

## 3. Segment Impact
Analyze impact by:
- User type (casual vs serious)
- Ad exposure level (high vs low)
- Geography or age groups

## 4. Design Experiments
- Test different **ad formats**:
  - Native-style ads (e.g., “sponsored profile”)
  - Post-match ads vs pre-match ads
  - Contextual ads (dating-related)

- Test **placement**:
  - In messages? In between matches? On the home screen?

## 5. Possible Solutions
- **Short term**: Roll back intrusive ad formats.
- **Medium term**: Replace with soft monetization (boosts, profile upgrades).
- **Long term**: Build ad formats tailored to romantic intent (e.g., sponsored date ideas, events).

## 6. Metrics to Monitor
- DAU/MAU
- Match rate
- Messaging rate
- Reported ad annoyance
- Click-through rate (CTR) on ads

## 7. Trade-offs

| Option                     | Pros                               | Cons                                 |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Keep ads and accept drop   | Monetization remains                | Long-term user loss                  |
| Remove ads temporarily     | Restores engagement                 | Lost revenue                         |
| Introduce premium model    | Higher LTV per user                 | Slower adoption                      |

## 8. Recommendation
1. Pause intrusive ad formats immediately.
2. Run multi-format ad tests with user surveys.
3. Shift to in-app purchases as a primary monetization path.

## 9. Elevator Pitch
“Monetizing dating needs to balance trust and intimacy. We’ll rethink ad formats to protect engagement and pivot toward non-intrusive models like boosts and premium filters.”
